# Redux powered React boilerplate

Heavily inspired by Cory House's ["Building a JavaScript Development Environment"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment) course at Pluralsight.

## Boilerplate includes:
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [React router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) (+ [react-redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html))
* [Bulma CSS framework](http://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/)
* Babel: Latest
* scss loader
* ESLint (eslint:recommended, react, import)
* Component testing with Mocha, Chai and Enzyme

## Usage instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Run ```yarn``` or ```npm install``` in the project's root folder
3. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the development server and start hacking

To share your work with anyone, you can run ```npm run share```, which temporarely opens up a port in your firewall and gives you an URL to share with anyone interested.
